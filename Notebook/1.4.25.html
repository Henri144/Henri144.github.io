<p style="color: white">today i went to the library to work on my mock trial stuff and its so stupid. i hate mock trial so much.... like you roleplay as a lawyer except you actually have to do a lot of work. i cant imagine how those people do it for fun. maybe im just jealous that theyre smarter than me idk.. i just know that every meetup is a chore, its like watching a boring and annoying friendgroup. i do my laugh thing when they say something they find funny and all. i cant quit now because i already signed up and i dont have a good excuse other than the fact that im a lazy loser. i think this is what a corperate job feels like. im prolly being too whiney right now but this is my epic website so i can say whatever.  
</p> last night i hallucinated ab some seahorses so im gonna make that the standard background now</p>
