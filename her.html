<h1><font color=#fb02ff style="font-size:50px">First Love</font>
  <div class="city">
    <p><font color=#fb02ff style="font-size:20px">I ne’er was struck before that hour </br>
      With love so sudden and so sweet, </br>
   Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower </br>
      And stole my heart away complete. </br>
   My face turned pale as deadly pale,</br>
      My legs refused to walk away,</br>
   And when she looked, what could I ail?</br>
      My life and all seemed turned to clay.</br>
    </br>
  </br>
   And then my blood rushed to my face</br>
      And took my eyesight quite away,</br>
   The trees and bushes round the place</br>
      Seemed midnight at noonday.</br>
   I could not see a single thing,</br>
      Words from my eyes did start—</br>
   They spoke as chords do from the string,</br>
      And blood burnt round my heart.</br>
    </br>
  </br>
   Are flowers the winter’s choice?</br>
      Is love’s bed always snow?</br>
   She seemed to hear my silent voice,</br>
      Not love’s appeals to know.</br>
   I never saw so sweet a face</br>
      As that I stood before.</br>
   My heart has left its dwelling-place</br>
      And can return no more.<p>
