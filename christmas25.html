     Dear Belle <br>
    I hope you dont mind me writing my card on my old abandond website because i dont think you can read my shitty handwriting. <br>
    2025's probably been my worst and best year so far sounds corny but with all the stuff going on around me like my family stuff going wrong, <br>
    having you to call and fall asleep on call with really makes a difference. You're the best girlfriend i can ask for, i get lots of love, attention, and cool gifts.<br>
    I've wanted this from you ever since i met you in 7th grade which was 4 years ago i think. After some burnouts and a few relationships that didnt work out we learned and <br>
    are finally together. Us getting together was the best thing that happened to me this year. <br>
    I love you more than anything. It might sound exaggerated but I seriously cant think of anything i love more than you.
    Sometimes after bad arguments or misunderstandings I might not show it but I can assure you <br>
    i will regret it every time and I'd do anything to make it right because I love you. <br>
    <br>
    You're the most beautiful and pure girl I can ask for and I'm constantly dreaming of our future together and I'd give anything to make it come true. <br>
    I'm so excited for what's to come when I get my liscense and when I get lucky enough to go to Montana with you. <br>
    Only when we finally get to live together will I be 100% happy. <br>
    I love you honey merry christmas and happy new year.
     <br>
     <br>
     ♡
